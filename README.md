# PINN
flow around circular cylinder
## Introduction 
This project provides a numerical solution for the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow over a cylinder at a Reynolds number (Re) of 200 using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN). This innovative approach leverages neural networks to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) and offers a powerful alternative to traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods.

### Navier-Stokes Equation

The governing equations for steady-state incompressible flow over a cylinder using the Navier-Stokes equations are given by:
